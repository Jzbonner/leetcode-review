⌛ Time Complexity
Access — O(1): Accessing an element in the list requires addressing it with the index.
Search — O(n): Searching if an element exists in a list requires (in the worst case) to traverse each index on by one
Insert/Delete — O(n): Inserting(Deleting) an element from a list first requires to be found which is O(n)
